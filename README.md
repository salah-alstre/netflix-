# Netflix-Like Platform

This is a project that simulates a Netflix-like platform, developed using React with Vite. The goal of this project is to showcase my abilities in web development. It allows users to browse trailers of movies and shows rather than watching the full content.

## Features
- Browse a collection of movie and show trailers, allowing users to discover the latest releases and upcoming titles.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface designed with React and Vite, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience.
- Responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, providing optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Dynamic loading of trailers using Firebase, enhancing performance and reducing load times for a better user experience.
- Engaging animations and transitions that improve overall interaction, making the browsing experience enjoyable and lively.
